# Workshop 4

## Productionisation of TensorFlow Models

### Objective

In this workshop, our objective is to showcase how to build a predictions service around a trained model and productionise it. In this case, that means to move it from the internal development environment and to make it accessible to other people and devices on the network. That could even be extended to be public on the internet and hosted on a company's server.
